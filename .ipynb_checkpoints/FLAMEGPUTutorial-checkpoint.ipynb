It is capable of running code in a wide variety of programming languages. Once the instance is up and running, you can simply click on the links, and start the tutorial in the web based environment. The notebook consists of cells which can be of type code or markdown (by default, new cells are created as *code* cells). If the content is code, it will be sent to the kernel for execution and output will be displayed in the footer of the cell. If the content is markdown, it will be rendered as HTML and serves as explanatory text. You can execute the content by clicking the **_Run_** button. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the implementation this will require , a fourth and fifth message type as grass should only be eaten by prey within a certain certain radius. The mechanism for \"grazing\" is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Grass agents which currently are currently available read the positions of the prey from the location messages to locate the nearest prey. \n",
    "2. If a prey was in eating range, a `grass_eaten_message` message is output. Note that if there is more than 1 prey on within the minimum distance, the grass agent should be eaten by the closest prey.\n",
    "3.  Grass agents then modify the `active` agent variable to indicate they are in a regrowth period and cannot be eaten at this time.\n",
    "4.  Prey agents read the `grass_eaten_message` messages and check to see if any match their ID. They then increase their energy accordingly.\n",
    "5. Prey agents die if they do not have enough life/energy.\n",

    "For simplicity a Grass agent description and corresponding function descriptions matching the behaviour described above have already been added to `src/main.cu`. In this exercise, you need to modify the `main.cu` file to add the following behaviour to the functions stubs described below (See [Last Section](#Editing-Files) on how to edit source files):\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3.1 *__grass_output_location__*: each grass agent outputs a `grass_location` message to provide information. In a more advanced model prey agent can use this information to migrate to areas of high food concentration.\n",
    "* 3.2 *__grass_eaten__*: each grass agent should iterate over `prey_location_messages` and checks the distance between its location and the prey agent. If the grass is available and the distances less than `GRASS_EAT_DISTANCE`, then the grass is eaten by the closet prey and the regrowth cycle starts. Note that if there are multiple preys within the `GRASS_EAT_DISTANCE`, then the closet prey to the grass, eats it and outputs a message `grass_eaten` containing the ID of the prey who ate it. This behaviour is very similar to prey checking if they are eaten by predators, you may wish to look at the `prey_eaten` function for inspiration. Once the grass is eaten, it should no longer be available until the `death_cycles` reaches `GRASS_REGROW_CYCLES`. \n",
    "* 3.3 *__prey_eat_or_starve__*: each prey agent iterates over `grass_eaten_messages` and checks the ID against it ID. If the grass eaten message indicates that this prey ate some grass then increase the prey's life by adding energy. If it's life is less than 1, the prey should die. This behaviour is similar to the `pred_eat_or_starve` function.\n",
    "* 3.4 *__grass_growth__*: If the the `death_cycles` variable is equal to `GRASS_REGROW_CYCLES`, then the grass agent becomes available and the `death_cycles` should restart. If the grass is not available (meaning the `death_cycles` variable is not equal to `GRASS_REGROW_CYCLES`), then the `death_cycles` variable should be incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where grass is included, prey agents require an energy (`life`) variable similar to predators. This variable is randomly selected from the interval of [0,50]. Once grass is eaten, the `available` variable is set to 0 and it takes up to `GRASS_REGROW_CYCLES` iterations till the grass re-grow. \n",
